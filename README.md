_Brief data analysis of two platforms for supporting transitions into data science_

**Disclaimer: I am not officially affliated with either Pathrise or Insight, this post represents my personal evaluation of each platform. Be sure to read through their material before making your final decision.**

## Intro
### About Me
As a PhD candidate in Environmetal Engineering, I have been exposed to data within the Earth system context for the better part of a decade. One thing that became apparent to me toward the end of my senior thesis project is that having the ability to process data in a programmatic environemnt is essential to getting the most information out of the measurements. However, I was unaware of how much fun and enjoyment I would gain from this specific process. Since 2004, [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=data%20science) reports that the term "data science" highlights an inflection point with an sharp increase in interest in 2015, peaking in September 2020 (originally searched Jan 2021). I have to admit that I have also caught the data science bug and have used my time in my PhD program to learn about data science and methods in order to prepare myself for a career in this field.

Though my story is not completely written yet, I have found it challenging to gain interest from employers. This post discusses two relevant paths to gaining employment as a data scientist. I am predominately gearing this for graduate students who graduating or have graduated from programs that not computer science, mathematics (pure/applied), and statistics. In my experience, the aforementioned programs are sought after by employers (with good reason) and other programs have a little harder time. Physics/Astrophysics and Electrical Engineering may also be preferred by employers. 

The two platforms discussed in this article are: 1) [Pathrise](https://www.pathrise.com/) and 2) [Insight](https://insightfellows.com/data-science). 

### Pathrise
Pathrise is a career advancement startup funded by Y Combinator and a number of other venture firms. They support students looking for employment and professionals seeking a new job or carreer change. Through this progam, clients can get a mix of one-on-one support and other materials to assist them with getting a job. The cost for this service is free upfront and Pathrise claims that if the client does not get hired within 12 months, the client will not pay anything. However, if the client lands a job, they are responsible for paying 9% of their pre-tax annual income within the first six months. For example, if the client signs a 100,000 USD per year offer in January, they will owe Pathrise 9,000 USD and will pay 1,500 USD each month through June.

### Insight
On the other hand, Insight is a post-doctoral fellowship program that takes place over seven weeks. Applicants apply to be placed in one of the following locations: Boston, Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, and Sillicon Valley. There is also a remote option that allows the fellow to get hired in an assortment of ther locations (_e.g._, Denver/Boulder, Atlanta, Chicago). After a being accepted into the program, fellows go through an intensive program that consists of a self-directed project with guidance from industry experts. Insight also advertise a strong network that gaurentees the following: the fellow will get employed for 90,000 USD or more, employment will occur within 6 months, and the job will be in a relevant field. Financing the Insight fellowship also uses an income sharing agreement. Insight requires that fellows pay 12% of their pre-tax annual salary for two years. Using the same example above, if the fellow signs for 100,000 USD they will owe Insight 12,000 each year for their first two years of employment. The fellow will pay in monthly installments; therfore for 24 connescutive months, the employee will pay 1,000 each month to Insight.

### Which one?
Assuming these are the only two options being considered, how does one make the right decision? Answering this question will require introspection and an analysis of what personally matters to you, but my hope is that this blog post will illuminate the experience and outcomes from the two programs.
